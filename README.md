  This game uses SimpleGUICS2Pygame as its API for graphics and input.
  You can simply install it by running the following command:

```bash
pip install SimpleGUICS2Pygame
```

or

```bash
pip3 install SimpleGUICS2Pygame
```

or if you have downloaded the repository, you can install all the requirements by running:

```bash
# in the root dir of the repo
pip install -r requirements.txt

## üëæ Running the game

Navigate to the root directory of the repository and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python app.py
```

or

```bash
# if python3 installed
python3 app.py
```

The directory structure should look like this:

```markdown
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sprite/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ audio/
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

**`app.py` is the main file that runs the game.** - has the main game loop -> simplegui API calls - has the main state machine

## üêû Known Issues

The SimpleGUICS2Pygame API is a buggy and outdated/unspported repo, causing some issues with the game. The game may not run as expected on some systems.
These issues are mostly related to the API itself and not the game code.
Some of the bugs cannot be patched since our project requirements prohibit us from using other APIs.

#### ‚ÄºÔ∏è Audio Device

The API requires an audio device to be present on the system. If the system does not have an audio device, the game will not run.
This does **not** mean that the system has to be unmuted; it just needs to have an audio device present.

#### Sounds and Music

- Rapidly shooting will not play the sound effect upon clicking.
- The background music stops playing after a while.
- Any sound effect being played gets in a queue and will not play simultaneously with other sounds.

**Planned solution:** Alternative audio API

#### Graphics

- The scaling system is somewhat random and broken; depending on the system, the game may not scale properly. **Unpatchable**
- Resizing the game window is not supported. **Unpatchable**

#### Binary Distribution

The `.exe` file will be available soon.
