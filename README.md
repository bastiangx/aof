- ##### SimpleGUICS2Pygame

  This game uses SimpleGUICS2Pygame as its API for graphics and input.
  You can simply install it by running the following command:

```bash
pip install SimpleGUICS2Pygame
```

or

```bash
pip3 install SimpleGUICS2Pygame
```

or if you have downloaded the repository, you can install all the requirements by running:

```bash
# in the root dir of the repo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

if none of the above solutions works, visit [here](https://pypi.org/project/SimpleGUICS2Pygame/) and follow the instructions for your OS.


## 👾 Running the game

Navigate to the root directory of the repository and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python app.py
```

or

```bash
# if python3 installed
python3 app.py
```

The directory structure should look like this:

```markdown
.
├── REDME.md
├── app.py
├── gameplay.py
├── ...
└── assets/
   ├── sprite/
   ├── audio/
   └── ...
```

**`app.py` is the main file that runs the game.** - has the main game loop -> `simplegui` API calls - has the main state machine



## 🎮 Controls

#### ⌨️ Movement

- `W` or `↑`  Move up
- `A` or `←`   Move left
- `S` or `↓`    Move down
- `D` or `→`   Move right

#### 🔫 Shooting

- `mouse left click` | Shoot

## 🐞 Known Issues

- The `SimpleGUICS2Pygame` API is a buggy and outdated/unspported repo, causing some issues with the game. 
- The game may not run as expected on some systems.

- These issues are mostly related to the API itself and not the game code.

- Some of the bugs cannot be patched since our project requirements prohibit us from using other APIs.

#### ‼️ Audio Device

The API requires an audio device to be present on the system. If the system does not have an audio device, the game will not run.
This does **not** mean that the system has to be unmuted; it just needs to have an audio device present.

#### Sounds and Music

- Rapidly shooting will not play the sound effect upon clicking.
- The background music stops playing after a while.
- Any sound effect being played gets in a queue and will not play simultaneously with other sounds.

**Planned solution:** Alternative audio API

#### Graphics

- The scaling system is somewhat random and broken; depending on the system, the game may not scale properly. **Unpatchable**
- Resizing the game window is not supported. **Unpatchable**



#### Binary Distribution

The `.exe` file will be available soon.
